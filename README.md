AI Image Generator

# 🧠 Task 02: Image Generation with Pre-trained Models

> **Internship Role**: Generative AI Intern  
> **Company**: CodeCraft  
> **Task Title**: Image Generation using Pre-trained Models  
> **Tech Stack**: Google Colab, Hugging Face Diffusers, Stable Diffusion, Gradio, Python

---

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of this task was to build an **AI-powered image generator** using **pre-trained generative models** such as `DALL·E-mini` or `Stable Diffusion`. The model should accept text prompts and generate corresponding images using a clean user interface.

---

## 🚀 Project Summary

I successfully developed an **AI Image Generator** web app using the **Stable Diffusion v1-4** model from Hugging Face. The app is deployed using **Gradio** and hosted for free via **Google Colab** with a shareable link for public use.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Python` | Programming language |
| `Hugging Face diffusers` | To load and run Stable Diffusion model |
| `Gradio` | For building the UI and API |
| `Google Colab` | To run the model using free GPU |
| `safetensors` | Safe model checkpointing and loading |

---

## 🧪 Features

- ✅ Generate high-quality images from text prompts
- ✅ Simple, clean Gradio UI
- ✅ Public link to share with users
- ✅ Uses `CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4` for realistic results
- ✅ Runs on GPU (via Colab) with no login/token required

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

During this task, I learned:

- How to work with **pre-trained generative models**
- How to use **Hugging Face Diffusers and Transformers**
- How to build and share **Gradio web interfaces**
- How to handle deployment challenges (e.g., GPU limitations on Hugging Face)
- How to deploy apps on **Google Colab** with `share=True` for public use
- Fundamentals of **text-to-image generation** using deep learning

## 📁 Project Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `app.py` | Main Python file containing the image generation logic |
| `requirements.txt` | Python libraries needed to run the app |
| `README.md` | Project overview and documentation |

---

## 💡 Future Improvements

- Allow image size and style customization
- Add multiple image generation (num_images=2,3,...)
- Add gallery to view generated history
- Deploy permanently on Hugging Face (when GPU access available)

## 👏 Special Thanks

To the team at **CodeCraft** for this incredible opportunity and guidance throughout the internship!
